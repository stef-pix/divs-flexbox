                I was born and raised in south Florida, but my family heritage lies in southern Italy. I have family in Sicily that I keep in touch with. As a first generation american, I have family in Sicily that I've had to visit often. As a result is that I now hate traveling.

                My passion: I LOVE art - its been one of the most influential and guiding forces in my life. I think art has the power to make a positive difference in the world by introducing new ways of thinking and looking at things. I get my fix by visiting galleries and museums.

                A fun fact: I love learning and trying new things, and as a native Floridian I love outdoor activities! I'm a beginner roller skater, and recently sprained my ankle while teaching myself how to skate! I can't wait to get back on my skates and roll!
